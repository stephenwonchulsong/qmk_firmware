# Sadek Baroudi's keymap for Corne (crkbd)

Don't forget that you have to make and flash both sides for RGB related features:
// For the left side (or whatever the master side is)
make crkbd:sadekbaroudi

// For the right side (or whatever the slave side is)
make crkbd:sadekbaroudi RGB_MATRIX_SPLIT_RIGHT=yes
